          <ul>
<li><p>If you're looking for <strong>Salsa</strong> or <strong>West-Coast Swing</strong> instruction, you've found the right place;
we offer a progressive version of both classes, not to mention our reportoire of ballroom dances like <strong>samba</strong> and
<strong>foxtrot.</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Classes are $10 for "drop-in" students, but the price per class is lower if more classes are taken. There's also
the option to pay a flat rate of $100 per month for all classes offered.</p></li>

<li><p>Even if you are just looking for somewhere to find new friends, we can help you out. We're all a big family, here
at the studio.</p></li>

<li><p>On the fence about joining? If you're scared, it's okay to be scared. Many individuals join us who are, at first, 
quite terrified - but ask any of them, and you'll hear anything but regret. Please give it a try!</p></li>

  <div class="content active" id="panel1a">
      <p>All public classes at DioAmore are group classes.<br>(For some one-on-one time, you'll need to schedule a private lesson.)</p>
	
	

	   			<p>
	   			Before introducing the dynamics of a regular class, it is important to understand the difference between a "progressive" session, and a "drop-in" session:

	   				
	   					<p> A <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="Progressive classes include Salsa, West-Coast Swing and Ballroom classes over the course of one month.">progressive</span> session requires that you sign up from the <em>beginning</em> of the month,
	   			and continues on until the end of that particular month. <em>You are expected to attend all sessions.</em> "Lost" classes cannot be
	   			"made up".</p>
	   					<p>A <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" title="Drop-in classes include all fitness classes, as well as all line-dancing lessons.">drop-in</span> session is flexible, allowing you to take a <em>singular</em> class at a time - with no commitments.</p>
	   				
	   			</p>

                
	   			
	   			<p>You are not explicitly required to bring any partner to our classes, but you may need feet. By the way,
	   			you are allowed to wear nothing but socks on your feet - but you may find that this gets tiring after some time.
				Sneakers are not recommended, as they grip the floor too much. A better approach might be a jazz sneaker.
	   			Do what best suits you!</p>

	   			<p>For <em>dance classes</em>, you will be required to dance with all attendees for at least a significant fragment of the time allocated to the given class - but, as was mentioned before, you do not need to bring anyone with you when you come through the door.</p>

	   			<p><em>Fitness classes</em>, though, are slightly different; for the most part, you won't be required to interact (physically) with other members that attend the class that you intend to take. You will, however, be quite sweaty by the end of the session. On a more serious note, you aren't expected to go beyond the limits of your body - we believe in working towards a goal, instead of pushing the boundaries of safety.</p>

	   			<p>Congratulations, you are now up to date on how group classes work here at the studio!</p>
  

  </div>
  <div class="content" id="panel2a">
        <p>There are two different skill levels that you should be aware of. Accordingly, these are termed:</p>

	   			<p><em>"Fun-d", fundamentals, or beginner</em></p> 
      
                    <p>These classes are open to all students of all levels.
                        These classes will focus on good technique, timing and build a strong foundation for your dancing.</em></p>

	   			<p><em>Intermediate/Advanced</em></p>

<p>Intermediate classes are appropriate for those with previous dance experience and/or those students who have 
successfully completed the <em>fundamental/beginner</em> level. These classes focus on more advanced patterns, 
cleaner technique, and styling. Students at the intermediate level are expected to know the entire <em>fundamental/beginner</em> 
class syllabus and be able to perform it competently with a partner. If you are unsure if this class is right 
for you, please ask your instructor for guidance.

            <div class="content" id="panel3a">
         <p>Just half an hour to abs your friends will be jealous of!  If your mid-section is your problem, than we have the <em>AbSolution.</em> You will feel the burn as we tone, tighten and flatten out your core to give you "fab" abs. This will be a challenging class - <em>no whining allowed!</em> The use of a yoga-style mat will be involved. A limited amount of mats are available for use in the studio; of course, you may bring your own, too. Bare feet are recommended for this class.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="panel4a">
          <p>Each month we rotate through two new dances - one dance in <em>Beginner Ballroom I</em>, and a different dance
in <em>Beginner Ballroom II</em>. Since the dances are taught quickly (typically over four sessions) they are designed to be an 
introduction; as such, students can expect to learn the basic and a few beginner 
patterns for the given dance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="panel5a">
         <p>It could be thirty minutes to a behind you could bounce a quarter off of! If it's "saggin", "baggin", "draggin", or just "ain't what it used to be", drop in to <em>Booty Boot Camp</em> and begin hearing how they "hate to see you go, but love to watch you leave"! This will be a <em>challenging class</em>. As with certain other classes, floor mats will be utilized; some are available at the studio, but you may also bring your very own.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="panel6a">
          <p><em>Cardio kickboxing</em> is a total body workout that will quickly sculpt the arms, shoulders, core, glutes and legs. This class will teach you how to safely and effectively throw punches and kicks, while improving your <em>strength, agility, speed, reaction time and cardiac fitness.</em> Not to mention, it is a lot of fun! You do like fun, don't you? Cardio kickboxing won't just toughen you up, it will tighten you up!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="panel7a">
          <p>From my years of experience working with seniors, I've seen firsthand what life can do to the body - especially with the kind of lifestyles we live these days. Hours in front of computers, hours <em>sitting at desks</em>, hours in front of the <em>boob tube</em>, and hours <em>standing on our feet</em> do not contribute to our health.</p>
          <p> This class aims to be both <em>preventative and rehabilitative</em> for joint and muscle mobility and flexibility.  It will increase range of motion, and decrease painful stiffness. This class will essentially be an isolations warm-up, with some stretching involved. We will cover <em>neck, shoulders, elbows, chest, back, hips, knees</em>, and even the little joints of the <em>ankles, wrists, fingers and toes.</em></p>
          <p> If you have any <em>range of motion limitations</em>, are <em>tight anywhere in the body</em>, are developing/have any issues such as <em>carpal tunnel and plantar fasciitis </em>, or just generally feel stiff and tight, or want to prevent your body from having any of these issues, then this class is for YOU!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="panel8a">
          <p>Part <em>pi</em>lates, part <em>yo</em>ga, part <em>cal</em>lanetics. This class will work on <em>stretching</em> and <em>strengthening</em> the whole body through common pilates, yoga and callanetics exercises. Pi-Yo-Cal is a fantastic <em>low-impact class</em> that is excellent for anybody, especially individuals with back, knee and/or joint problems, and those working on physical rehabilitation. This class will <em>tone, tighten, strengthen and lengthen</em> all in one! The class is obviously one part yoga - this results in floor mat usage. Bare feet are recommended.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="panel9a">
          <p>Beginner <em>Salsa</em> classes are designed to give you all the basics you will need to be a competent beginner dancer on the dance floor. Lessons are <em>progressive</em>, and class is held twice per week. New sessions begin at the start of a given month. Once you have your basics down, you are welcome to join the intermediate class - we'll focus on new patterns, improved technique, cleaner footwork, and styling. Take your salsa to the next level! </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="panel10a">
          <p>Brought to the world by the U.S. Navy SEALS, and developed by Fitness Anywhere®, <em>Suspension Training</em>® is a revolutionary method of leveraged bodyweight exercise. Safely perform hundreds of functional exercises that build <em>power, strength, flexibility, balance, mobility</em>, and prevent injuries, all at the <em>intensity you choose</em>. Whether you are a seriously conditioned athlete, have encountered limitations in other forms of exercises due to past injuries, or are seriously deconditioned and out of shape, <em>TRX is perfect for all fitness levels</em>. Regardless of whether your goal is to improve your football game, improve joint mobility, get ripped abs, get back that cute little figure you had in high school, or just enjoy a healthier way of life, TRX will help you attain those goals!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="panel11a">
          <p>Beginner <em>West Coast Swing classes</em> will arm you with the knowledge necessary to dance at an entry level. Lessons are <em>progressive</em>, and class is held twice per week. New sessions will begin at the start of a given month. As with the intermediate salsa class, you will be interested in the intermediate level - once you're comfortable with all of the basic patterns of the beginner level. We hope you will be able to reach your goals!</p>

          <p><em>Zumba</em> is a <em>dance fitness class</em>, with its main focus being FUN! If you're not having fun, you're not doing it right.</p>
          <p> Zumba means, "Let's Party!" The class makes use of all styles of international music - from <em>salsa</em> to <em>flamenco</em>, to <em>hip hop</em> and <em>belly dancing.</em> Men and women in an average weight range will typically burn <em>350-650 calories per hour</em><sub><a href="http://www.acefitness.org/certifiednewsarticle/2813/">1</a></sub>. The main idea behind Zumba is to simply make it <em>FUN and EASY</em> for everyone of every fitness level to enjoy an exhilerating workout. You can even be sitting down and participating!</p>
          <p>You do not need to dance like the instructor, or any other individual. <em>Pace</em> yourself! Leave your ego at the door, and honor your body - by getting the workout your body needs. Rule number one in this class is to have FUN!  Rule number two is to KEEP MOVING! We not care what you do, or how you do it; as long as you are moving, your heart is racing, and your sweat is pouring. If you follow these guidelines, fitness can finally be fun! Forget "working out". Come party with us in <em>Zumba!</em> </p>

<div id="faq">
<dl class="accordion" data-accordion="">
        <dd>
            <a href="#panel1b">What else do I need to know?</a>

            <div class="content" id="panel1b"><p>
We're a happy bunch. Leave your negativity out the door, and even if you've had a bad day, prepare to smile, laugh, 
and have fun. Grumpy, mean, stuck-up, snobby, argumentative, negative, petty, and rude people are not particularly "our 
kind of people". Kind, generous, happy, joyful, positive, loving, encouraging, friendly, and fun people are REALLY welcome.</p>

<p>When you come in, take a look at the white to the right of the entrance. This board is updated regularly, and will have information 
and messages about upcoming events that are important. Smile and greet your friends, and introduce yourself to new faces. Finally, 
make your way over to the sign-in sheet, and check off the classes you will be attending for that day.</p>

<p>Please put your phones on silent! Noise - other than music that is being played - is disruptive to the class setting.</p>

<p>Mints and gum are provided at the registration desk for you. Please be courteous, and take only one of them.  They are provided 
free for everyone, so please be considerate. Hand sanitizer and tissues are also provided.  The idea is to have decent breath
and sanitary hands when you are interacting with others.  :)</p>

<p>You'll also find a collection of personal care products in the bathroom. Hair products, lotion, deodorant sprays, Q-tips, feminine 
care products, floss, and face wipes, among other things, are provided. If you sweated up a storm during class, ran here from 
work, or just arrived here from your garlic and onion dinner, you may need a little "pick-me-up", so feel free to utilize our
products. We want you to look as good as that power-point presentation that you spent all night producing, yeah? Like we've
said before, this is your second home. </p>

<p>Studio cubbies are for you. If you're a regular, you can claim a cubby for yourself to store the things you may regularly use in 
the studio, such as water bottles, hand weights, sweat towels, hair ties, dance shoes, and anything else. This is your piece of the 
studio. Additionally, your mats and foam rollers (&lt;24in.) can be stored at the studio. Please put your name on the edge of your
stored items, for easy identification; be sure to place it in the proper cubby.</p>    

<p>Leave your ego out the door - it's of no use to you, here. Let your hair down, let go, be a little sillier, and laugh at yourself. When 
something gets hard, don't give up. Try harder! Your weakness doesn't help you on your journey through life, and giving up doesn't give 
you strength of character.  Never believe you are not capable of doing something. Be open to corrections, and give the best you have to give.</p>

<p>"Can't" is a bad word at the studio. Don't say it. It brings bad energy into our space, and we won't believe you when 
you say it. Instead, proclaim that you are "finding it challenging", or "working towards accomplishing it".  You are on a journey 
towards accomplishing something - we all are. Life is a series of challenges, in which we are given opportunities to grow stronger 
in mind, body and spirit. You cannot be brave without first having something to fear. You will not grow stronger without first having 
something to challenge you beyond your current strength. You do not learn to fly without first trusting your feet off the ground. You 
will never know your own strength, if you defeat yourself in your head first. Let others say you can't. There is always someone out 
there who is willing to push you down so they can feel better. Don't be that person. You are a person who can, and will.</p>  

<p>Honor your body. Don't do things you shouldn't, but don't neglect what you should be doing. This includes exercises, movements, and 
your dietary intake. You are not here to impress anyone but yourself. Do what is right for your body by modifying when necessary, but 
participating somehow. Go as hard as YOU can for as long as YOU can. That is all we ask.</p>

                        Clothing that will not require constant adjustment as
                        you move would be ideal. Fabric that breathes is often
                        beneficial. What's more, try not to wear anything too
                        loose - your body is a part of the dance, not just your
                        legs. For footwear, specifics are described in detail
                        within the following sections - but, as a general rule,
                        don't dance in shoes that have marking soles. These
                        create "scuffs" that are difficult to clean.</p>

                        <p>A ballroom shoe is most appropriate for dance
                        classes. Ballroom shoes have suede bottoms, stay on
                        feet properly (as opposed to a "slip-on" shoe or
                        flip-flops), and are usually more flexible than your
                        traditional shoe. Another good choice is the jazz
                        sneaker. Jazz sneakers have no arch, which allows for
                        additional flexibility, and are not sticky on the
                        bottom; this allows for easier turns. If these are not
                        viable options for you, any shoes that are not too
                        sticky, not too slippery, will stay on, and are
                        comfortable should work. Shoes that are not appropriate
                        for dance classes would be sticky, rubber-bottomed
                        shoes that make it difficult to turn in, shoes with
                        heels so high they are difficult to balance in, or
                        "slip-on" shoes such as mules or flip-flops. Dancing in
                        your socks would be preferable to those options.</p>

                        of preference here at the studio is the Vibram
                        Fivefinger®. These shoes are light, flexible, and most

                <p>As the person now responsible for your dance/fitness
                education, I prefer to never simply cancel a lesson; I'd rather
                reschedule it for another day or time, within the same week.
                However, in the event one should need to cancel their lesson, a
                notice three days in advance is greatly appreciated, so that I
                may be able to accommodate other students. Should a lesson be
                cancelled with less than one day's advance notice, there will
                be a charge of the lesson rate imposed.(Reasonable exceptions
                will be made.)</p>

                <h2>General classes</h2>

                <p>There are no refunds for cancellation of any lessons.

                <p>Tuition is due on the day of your first class - or, for
                returning students, on the first day you attend a class in the
                new month. For example, if the first class you attend is on
                Tuesday the fourth, you would register for all of your classes
                on the that date, given that you are not paying on a per-class
                basis. Taking more classes would mean lower payment per class,
                but you can also opt to pay for individual classes. (Visit the
                "Lessons" tab for more information.)</p>

                <p>There will be a ten day grace period from when you have
                taken your first class in the month to make a payment. After
                ten days, we will apply a late fee of $20 to your account. We
                appreciate your cooperation, as this helps to keep the
                administrative work easy and efficient. (We don't want to add a
                fee, so just make it easy and pay us at the first of the month,
