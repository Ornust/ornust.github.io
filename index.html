			<p>All public classes at DioAmore are group classes.<br>(For some one-on-one time, you'll need to schedule a private lesson.)</p>
	
	

	   			<p>
	   			Before introducing the dynamics of a regular class, it is important to understand the difference between a "progressive" session, and a "drop-in" session:

	   				<ul>
	   					<li> A <em>progressive</em> session requires that you sign up from the <em>beginning</em> of the month,
	   			and continues on until the end of that particular month. <em>You are expected to attend all sessions.</em> "Lost" classes cannot be
	   			"made up".</li>
	   					<li>A <em>drop-in</em> session is flexible, allowing you to take a <em>singular</em> class at a time - with no commitments.</li>
	   				</ul>
	   			</p>
	   			
	   			<p>You are not explicitly required to bring any partner to our classes, but you may need feet. By the way,
	   			you are allowed to wear nothing but socks on your feet - but you may find that this gets tiring after some time.
				Sneakers are not recommended, as they grip the floor too much. A better approach might be a jazz sneaker.
	   			Do what best suits you, as long as that doesn't involve equipping a full suit of armor. Sorry, King Arthur!</p>

	   			<p>For <em>dance classes</em>, you will be required to dance with all attendees of the opposite sex for at least a significant fragment of the time allocated to the given class - but, as was mentioned before, you do not need to bring anyone with you when you come through the door.</p>

	   			<p><em>Fitness classes</em>, though, are slightly different; for the most part, you won't be required to interact (physically) with other members that attend the class that you intend to take. You will, however, be quite sweaty by the end of the session. On a more serious note (Aw, shucks), you aren't expected to go beyond the limits of your body - we believe in working towards a goal, instead of pushing the boundaries of safety.</p>

	   			<p>Congratulations, you are now up to date on how group classes work here at the studio! Pass GO and collect $200.</p>

	   	<label for="lsnacd2">Skill Tiers</label>
	   	<div class="lsncontent" id="lsncontent2">
	   	<p>There are three different skill levels that you should be aware of. Accordingly, these are termed:</p>

	   			<p><em>"Fun-d", fundamentals, or beginner</em> - all students are allowed to attend these classes, as they are
	   			intended to teach new students; of course, if the luster of your knowledge resembles an abandoned Volkswagen, we
	   			won't complain when you come rushing into the studio. You'll work on <em>basic steps, technique</em> and <em>timing.</em></p>

	   			<p><em>Beyond beginner</em> - The class to take when you feel your skills are precisely between beginner and intermediate, or if your particular class has progressed to this point. Not sure? Howl out to the appropriate instructor for guidance. No, don't actually howl. It's just an expression. You'll work on <em>more interesting patterns</em>, making your technique <em>easy, correct and interesting</em>, and <em>expansion upon fundamental concepts.</em></p>

	   			<p><em>Intermediate</em> - This is the highest publically offered skill tier. If you think you're ready, your instructor will decide whether you are adequately equipped to handle the information you receive here; the great majority depends on your success in the previous grade(s), or, alternatively, previous dance experience in general. Sometimes, more advanced ideas are worked through. After you have taken enough classes to feel comfortable with your skills, you may wish to show them off somewhere! This will develop you rapidly. And, after all, we are devoted to your success. Aren't we so nice? You'll work on: <em>styling your patterns,</em> further development of <em>advanced technique</em>, making your patterns <em>precise and fluid</em>, and <em>general interaction tips</em> with a dance partner.

This will be a challenging class - <em>no whining allowed!</em> The use of a yoga-style mat will be involved.

	   			<p>From my years of experience working with seniors, I've seen firsthand what life can do to the body - especially with the kind of lifestyles we live these days. Hours in front of computers, hours <em>sitting at desks</em>, hours in front of the <em>boob tube</em>, and hours <em>standing on our feet</em> do not contribute to our health.</p>
	   			<p> This class aims to be both <em>preventative and rehabilitative</em> for joint and muscle mobility and flexibility.  It will increase range of motion, and decrease painful stiffness. This class will essentially be an isolations warm-up, with some stretching involved. We will cover <em>neck, shoulders, elbows, chest, back, hips, knees</em>, and even the little joints of the <em>ankles, wrists, fingers and toes.</em></p>
	   			<p> If you have any <em>range of motion limitations</em>, are <em>tight anywhere in the body</em>, are developing/have any issues such as <em>carpal tunnel and plantar fasciitis </em>, or just generally feel stiff and tight, or want to prevent your body from having any of these issues, then this class is for YOU!</p>

Pi-Yo-Cal is a fantastic <em>low-impact class</em> that is excellent for anybody, especially individuals with back, knee and/or joint problems, and those working on physical rehabilitation. This class will <em>tone, tighten, strengthen and lengthen</em> all in one! The class is obviously one part yoga - this results in floor mat usage. Bare feet are recommended.</p>

	   			<p> Zumba means, "Let's Party!" The class makes use of all styles of international music - from <em>salsa</em> to <em>flamenco</em>, to <em>hip hop</em> and <em>belly dancing.</em> Men and women in an average weight range will typically burn <em>350-650 calories per hour</em><sub><a href="http://www.acefitness.org/certifiednewsarticle/2813/">1</a></sub>. The main idea behind Zumba is to simply make it <em>FUN and EASY</em> for everyone of every fitness level to enjoy an exhilerating workout. You can even be sitting down and participating!</p>
	   			<p>You do not need to dance like the instructor, or any other individual. <em>Pace</em> yourself! Leave your ego at the door, and honor your body - by getting the workout your body needs. Rule number one in this class is to have FUN!  Rule number two is to KEEP MOVING! We not care what you do, or how you do it; as long as you are moving, your heart is racing, and your sweat is pouring. If you follow these guidelines, fitness can finally be fun! Forget "working out". Come party with us in <em>Zumba!</em> </p>

				<p>Allow us to unleash a veritable symphony of learning upon the very fibers of your SOUL:</p>

				<textarea readonly rows="100" cols="120">

We&apos;re a happy bunch. Leave your negativity out the door, and even if you&apos;ve had a bad day, prepare to smile, laugh, 
and have fun. Grumpy, mean, stuck-up, snobby, argumentative, negative, petty, and rude people are not particularly &quot;our 
kind of people&quot;. Kind, generous, happy, joyful, positive, loving, encouraging, friendly, and fun people are REALLY welcome. 

When you come in, take a look at the white to the right of the entrance. This board is updated regularly, and will have information 
and messages about upcoming events that are important. Smile and greet your friends, and introduce yourself to new faces. Finally, 
make your way over to the sign-in sheet, and check off the classes you will be attending for that day.

Please put your phones on silent! Noise - other than music that is being played - is disruptive to the class setting.

Mints and gum are provided at the registration desk for you. Please be courteous, and take only one of them.  They are provided 
free for everyone, so please be considerate. Hand sanitizer and tissues are also provided.  The idea is to have decent breath
and sanitary hands when you are interacting with others.  :)

You&apos;ll also find a collection of personal care products in the bathroom. Hair products, lotion, deodorant sprays, Q-tips, feminine 
care products, floss, and face wipes, among other things, are provided. If you sweated up a storm during class, ran here from 
work, or just arrived here from your garlic and onion dinner, you may need a little &quot;pick-me-up&quot;, so feel free to utilize our
products. We want you to look as good as that power-point presentation that you spent all night producing, yeah? Like we've
said before, this is your second home. 

Studio cubbies are for you. If you&apos;re a regular, you can claim a cubby for yourself to store the things you may regularly use in 
the studio, such as water bottles, hand weights, sweat towels, hair ties, dance shoes, and anything else. This is your piece of the 
studio. Additionally, your mats and foam rollers (&lt;24in.) can be stored at the studio. Please put your name on the edge of your
stored items, for easy identification; be sure to place it in the proper cubby.    

Leave your ego out the door - it&apos;s of no use to you, here. Let your hair down, let go, be a little sillier, and laugh at yourself. When 
something gets hard, don’t give up. Try harder! Your weakness doesn&apos;t help you on your journey through life, and giving up doesn&apos;t give 
you strength of character.  Never believe you are not capable of doing something. Be open to corrections, and give the best you have to give.

&quot;Can&apos;t&quot; is a bad word at the studio. Don&apos;t say it. It brings bad energy into our space, and we won&apos;t believe you when 
you say it. Instead, proclaim that you are &quot;finding it challenging&quot;, or &quot;working towards accomplishing it&quot;.  You are on a journey 
towards accomplishing something - we all are. Life is a series of challenges, in which we are given opportunities to grow stronger 
in mind, body and spirit. You cannot be brave without first having something to fear. You will not grow stronger without first having 
something to challenge you beyond your current strength. You do not learn to fly without first trusting your feet off the ground. You 
will never know your own strength, if you defeat yourself in your head first. Let others say you can&apos;t. There is always someone out 
there who is willing to push you down so they can feel better. Don&apos;t be that person. You are a person who can, and will.  

Honor your body. Don't do things you shouldn&apos;t, but don't neglect what you should be doing. This includes exercises, movements, and 
your dietary intake. You are not here to impress anyone but yourself. Do what is right for your body by modifying when necessary, but 
participating somehow. Go as hard as YOU can for as long as YOU can. That is all we ask.

			<label for="faq1">How do I get started?</label>
			<div class="faqcontent">
			
			<p>Just show up!  Arrive a little early for your class. You will receive a liability waiver and a new student sheet to fill out - after that, pay your tuition, and you are ready to go!</p>

			<label for="faq2">When do I pay tuition? What is the late fee policy?</label>
			<div class="faqcontent">
			
			<p>Tuition is due on the day of your first class - or, for returning students, on the first day you attend a class in the new month.
For example, if the first class you attend is on Tuesday the fourth, you would register for all of your classes on the that date, given that you are not paying on a per-class basis. Taking more classes would mean lower payment per class, but you can also opt to pay for individual classes. (Visit the "Lessons" tab for more information. How did you get here first, huh?)</p><p> There will be a ten day grace period from when you have taken your first class in the month to make a payment. After ten days, we will apply a late fee of $20 to your account. We appreciate your cooperation, as this helps to keep the administrative work easy and efficient. (We don&apos;t want to add a fee, so just make it easy and pay us at the first of the month, pretty please.)</p>

				<label for="sfaq1" class="faqsub">Clothing and Footwear</label>
				<div class="faqcontent">
					<p>Wear whatever you are comfortable moving in.  Clothing that will <em>not require constant adjustment</em> as you move would be ideal. (I know how much you love that tube-top, but.. come on.) Fabric that breathes is often beneficial. What's more, try not to wear anything too loose - your body is a part of the dance, not just your legs.</p>
					
					<p>For footwear, specifics are described in detail within the following sections - but, as a general rule, <em>don't dance in shoes that have marking soles</em>. These create "scuffs" that are difficult to clean.</p>

				<input id="sfaq3" name="faq2" type="radio" />
				<label for="sfaq3" class="faqsub">Dance Classes</label>
				<div class="faqcontent">
					<p>A <em>ballroom shoe</em> is most appropriate for dance classes. Ballroom shoes have suede bottoms, stay on feet properly (as opposed to a "slip-on" shoe or flip-flops), and are usually more flexible than your traditional shoe. Another good choice is the <em>jazz sneaker</em>. Jazz sneakers have no arch, which allows for additional flexibility, and are not sticky on the bottom; this allows for easier turns.</p>

					<p>If these are not viable options for you, any shoes that are not too sticky, not too slippery, will stay on, and are comfortable should work. Shoes that are not appropriate for dance classes would be sticky, rubber-bottomed shoes that make it difficult to turn in, shoes with heels so high they are difficult to balance in, or "slip-on" shoes such as mules or flip-flops.  Dancing in your socks would be preferable to those options.</p>

				<label for="sfaq4" class="faqsub">Fitness Classes</label>
				<div class="faqcontent">
					<p>About <em>one-half</em> of the fitness classes can or should be done with bare feet. For the other classes, our shoe of preference here at the studio is the <em><a href="http://vibram.com/">Vibram Fivefinger</a>&reg;</em>. These shoes are <em>light, flexible</em>, and most importantly, allow your feet to work and move the way they were <em>meant to</em>. Vibram&reg; shoes will strengthen your feet and lower limbs, as well as improve balance and proprioception.</p>

			<label for="faq5">What if I miss a class?</label>
			<div class="faqcontent">
			
			<p>You are allowed to make up <em>drop-in</em> classes only for the month in which you missed your drop-in class. For example, you may make up classes you miss in <em>January</em>, but only in <em>January</em>. Missed classes for <em>progressive</em> classes cannot be made up; there is no replacement for missing the information in those types of classes - unless you schedule private lessons.</p>

			<p>You can take any of the regular weekly classes that are appropriate for your skill level. TRX classes are the <em>only exception to the rule</em>. TRX is NOT included in your <em>Unlimited</em> Membership - however, <em>Unlimited</em> members DO receive a dollar off discount off of each of their TRX classes. Specialty workshops and dances are held at an additional cost, but are often times discounted for our <em>Unlimited</em> members.  We encourage our <em>Unlimited</em> members to take as many classes as are open to them.</p>

			<label for="faq12">Do private lessons cost the same amount for a couple as they do for a single person?</label>
			<div class="faqcontent">
			
			<p>A private lesson price is the <em>same rate</em>, regardless of whether one or two students are being taught. Additional people are <em>$10 each</em>. A personal training session is reserved just for <em>one person</em>.</p>

			<input id="faq15" name="faq" type="radio"/>
			<label for="faq15">What is your cancellation policy?</label>
			<div class="faqcontent">
			
			<p><em>Private Sessions</em></p>
			<p>As the person now responsible for your dance/fitness education, I prefer to never simply cancel a lesson; I'd rather reschedule it for another day or time, within the same week. However, in the event one should need to cancel their lesson, a notice three days in advance is greatly appreciated, so that I may be able to accommodate other students. Should a lesson be cancelled with less than one day's advance notice, there will be a charge of the lesson rate imposed.(Reasonable exceptions will be made.)</p>
			<p><em>General classes</em></p>
			<p>There are no refunds for cancellation of any lessons. Lessons are not transferable to another party.</p>
